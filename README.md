# StrategicNoughtsAndCrosses
 Strategic Noughts and Crosses game made in VB.NET during my Computing A-Level
 
 The game is based on some online versions I played with friends previously. There are two players (on the same device) and whichever position you pick on the little 3x3 grid determines which little 3x3 grid your opponent gets to play in next. You can only click the buttons tha are enabled. The aim of the game is to win the larger grid, by winning a row of small 3x3 grids.
